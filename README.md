# VTools
Set of Blender functions and operators to speed up various operations/processes.

Functions
- - - - - - - - - -
Quick-access methods for use in the Python Console:
* Active(): gets the active object, in Object Mode
* ActiveAction(): gets the active action, selected in the Action Editor window
* ActiveBone(): gets the active bone of an armature, in either Edit Mode or Pose Mode
* SelectedVertex()/SelectedVertexes(): gets the active vertex/vertexes, in Edit Mode
* Get3DCursorPosition(): gets the location of the 3D cursor in world space
* Obj(name): gets the object with the given name
* Objects(): returns a list of all objects in the scene
* Selected(): gets the selected object, in Object Mode

#### Select keyframes in range

#### Copy keyframes to new action
Copies the selected keyframes to a new action.

#### Retarget action
Transforms the action's keyframes to be based-on/relative-to the active-object's armature's rest-pose, rather than the specified source-object's armature's rest-pose.

#### Move keyframes to
Move keyframe-segment, such that its first-frame becomes the given frame.

#### Copy keyframes to new actions

#### Focus on selected vertexes

#### Set position - local

#### Reset scale while preserving world space mesh

#### Separate islands into different objects

#### Create armature from object heirarchy

#### Convert action curves to datapath approach
Converts the active-action's curves from the [bone-name = group-name, component = data-path] approach, to the [bone-name = data-path-part, component = data-path-part] approach

#### Convert action rotation curves to quaternion type
Converts the active-action's rotation curves from the 3-prop euler type, to the 4-prop quaternion type.

#### Replace action curve bones
For each curve linked with old-bone-name, relink to new-bone-name.

#### Copy action curves for new bone
For each selected curve, duplicate curve and link duplicate with new-bone.

#### Create merged action from actions

#### Retarget action from object heirarchy to armature
Transforms the action's keyframes to be based-on/relative-to the active-object's armature's rest-pose, rather than the specified source-object's rest-pose.

#### Transform action keyframes
Transforms the action's keyframes, based on the transformation between from-object and to-object.
